# Rock Paper Scissors

A browser-based Rock Paper Scissors game built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Play against the computer and be the first to reach 5 points to win.

## Description

This is a week-one project from the Aurax Summer 2026 JavaScript series. It was built step by step — first the HTML structure, then the CSS styling, then the JavaScript logic — to practice the fundamentals of DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic without any libraries or frameworks.

## Features

- Play Rock, Paper, or Scissors against a computer opponent
- Computer makes a random choice each round
- Displays both the player's and computer's choice after each round
- Shows the result of each round (You Win / Computer Wins / Tie)
- Live scoreboard that updates after every round
- Game ends automatically when either side reaches 5 points
- Restart button resets the entire game back to its initial state
- Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
- Hover and active animations on all buttons
- Disabled button state prevents play after the game ends
